creating visual ETL job in GLUE

1. select AWS Glue Data Catalog as Source 
	choose the Data base (netflix), table(input)
	select the IAM role (should have access to S3, glue)
	
2. Then we have to Evaluate the Quality of Data. For that select "Evaluate Data Quality"
			Rules = [
		ColumnValues "imdb_score" >= 7.0
	]
	Here Evaluting the quality movies and shows which have IMDB rating above 7
	
	Under "Data quality transform output" 
	Enable both "Data quality results" and "Original data"
	Under "Original data" Enable "Add new columns to indicate data quality errors"
	
3. Storing the Rule outcome Data into the S3
	Select target "S3"
	selecting the format as JSON and Compression as None
	Select the target location (create output folder under our bucket)
	
4. for rowLevelOutcomes
	add transform (Conditional Router)
	change the outcome group name -> Failed Record
	filter condition :
						key = DataQualityEvaluationResult
						operation = matches
						value = Failed
						
5. Dumping the Failed records into the s3 
	select target as S3 (rename it to "bad_quality_data_dump") 
	target = netflix-movie-show-data/output/bad_quality_data_dump/
	selecting the format as JSON and Compression as None
	
6. For Success group (default_group)
	select "Change Schema"
		Rename- Drop_columns_and_change_dataType
		drop the data quality check columns
		and convert the long columns into int
		
7. To load the Data select target as "AWS Glue Data Catalog"
	Database - netflix
	table - dev_netflix_netflix_destination_table
	select temperarory load in "netflix-movie-show-data/output/temp_redshift_load"
	iam role - same role associated with our redshift cluster
	
8. Under Job Details tab
	Requested number of workers: 2
	in Job Paramters 
	key = --JOB-NAME
	
9. create s3 enpoint in the same vpc that of redshift cluster
	create s3 endpoint in redshift VPC 
	give s3 endpoint name 
	- > select services s3 (Service_Name = com.amazonaws.ap-south-1.s3) select Gateway 
	->select Redshift's VPC -> select the routing table -> policy => Full Access
	
	cloudwatch endpoint
	Service_Name = com.amazonaws.ap-south-1.monitoring
	select our vpc 
	select subnet which is associated with etl job (check in job-details)

	glue-vpc endpoint
	Service_Name = com.amazonaws.ap-south-1.glue
	select our vpc 
	select subnet which is associated with etl job (check in job-details)
