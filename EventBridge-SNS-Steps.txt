Creating EventBridge

we were sending our data quality result status(Failed or Success) to CloudWatch
now we are trying to capture it using EventBridge Pattern and integrate it to SNS Topic.
 So that whenever this Pipeline gets executed we can send the notification with failed or success status
 
 Steps:
 
 1. create EventBridge rule (name- netflixDQCheckStatusRule)
	select Rule Type - "Rule with an event pattern"
	Event Source - "AWS events or EventBridge partner events"
	Under Event Pattern
		select AWS Service - "Glue Data Quality"
		event type - " Data Quality Evaluation Results Available"
		Event Type Specification 1 - specific state- Select both "Success" "Failed"
			Below Pattern will be created
				{
					"source": ["aws.glue-dataquality"],
					"detail-type": ["Data Quality Evaluation Results Available"],
					"detail": {
						"state": ["FAILED", "SUCCEEDED"]
					}
				}
		
		Select Target "SNS Topic"
		
			create SNS Topic and subscribe it to desired email id
		
		select the created topic
